# Welcome to AroundMe
If you've ever been on a tour, or ever ventured out to a new place, you'd often would have faced the difficulty of deciding what all to explore within the given time constraint, or what all to buy within a given budget ensuring that you're not overcharged by the local vendors.
Or if you're running a business, sometimes you'd face the difficulty of pricing your product for the right market value, sometimes it'd be more than the market trends, and sometimes it'd be way lower.
And one of the primary concern about conserving and preserving our local heritage is supporting the traditional craftsmen and artists, who find it quite hard to sell their artistry, a solution to sell off their handicrafts is definitely required as a local area highlight.


If all these problems actually bug you, we bring to you AroundMe, an all in one web based solution for tourists, local vendors and tourist guides
